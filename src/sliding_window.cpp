#include "sliding_window.hpp"

// Implementations for template classes are typically in the header file. This
// .cpp file is often kept for organizational purposes or for explicit template
// instantiations if needed for specific types to manage compile times

// For example:
// template class SlidingWindow<int>; // Explicitly instantiate for int
// template class SlidingWindow<double>; // Explicitly instantiate for double
// (These would be needed if the definitions were in this .cpp file,
// but since they are in .hpp, these lines are not strictly necessary unless
// you want to ensure these specific versions are compiled into one object
// file.)
